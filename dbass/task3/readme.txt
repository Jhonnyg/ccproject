>Argh, I also forget to tell you to check, in "CourseRegistering",
>whether the student you try to insert has not already read the course.
Check!

>Also, you have to take care of the 'U's in "HasTaken".
Check!

>In "CourseUnregistration", one would expect do delete a student from the
>queue also; in your case, it turns the status from 'waiting' to 'registered' oO.
Check!

>Your task is almost acceptable, but the previous paragraph is a bullet
>of the assignment of the task 4 :P
Should pass now! :)
